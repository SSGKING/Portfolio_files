Feel free to have a look around
Wrath has a playable file if you wish to check it out just run the exe in the wrath file

To play my final robotron in unreal run the exe

All other files are very much half broken due to their specificity

There are two unreal projects that are not on this github I can send them to you if you wish to see them, however I cannot store them on here
To get the files send please email at AlexanderNeill64@outlook.com

There will be pictures just to show what it is though

Please check out the included Project_explanation file as it explains what each project is.
