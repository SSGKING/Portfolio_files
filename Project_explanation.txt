WHAT I DID....

I did a good chunk of the programming for wrath including animations and general movement for the player.

For the unreal version of robotron I did everything outside of the music, the robot model and it's animations, and of course this was in class.

For the pinball project that I did with Adam Fahrer, I did all the models for the game, all the textures, and UI alonglide some support for combining ui to C++ code.

HOW THIS IS USEFUL...

For the Wrath project I did it with a group of 4 people, and because of my leadership and flexibility we never had any merge errors.

For the Unreal Robotron project this shows my comfortability with Unreal, while it isn't the most impresive thing, I made it a point to try and get as good as I could without
using assets from the store.

Finaly for the pinball project, I didn't have much time to work on as the others, but I am still proud of what Adam and I were able to accomplish given our limited time
I think that my ability to quickly move out of the way of others and work where I am needed shows my capability as a generalist.
